# Analysis-of-Transport-System
## 🚍 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

* This project focuses on analyzing a Transport Management System using SQL.
* It evaluates operational performance such as vehicle utilization, route efficiency, trip frequency, and passenger movement.
* The objective is to extract meaningful insights from structured transport data stored in relational databases.

---

## 📌 **PROJECT STEPS**

### 📊 **1. DATA SET OVERVIEW**

* Structured relational database containing transport-related tables.
* Includes Vehicles, Drivers, Routes, Trips, Passengers, Bookings, and Schedules.
* Data fields may include trip date, route ID, vehicle ID, passenger count, fare amount, and trip status.

---

### 🧮 **2. ANALYTICAL METHODS**

* Data filtering and aggregation using SQL operations.
* Grouping and summarization for route-wise and vehicle-wise performance.
* Joining multiple tables to analyze trip and booking relationships.
* Sorting and performance comparison across time periods.

---

### 🎯 **3. SCOPE OF THE STUDY**

* Limited to operational and performance analysis of the transport system.
* Focuses on trip data, passenger movement, and vehicle usage.
* Does not include fuel cost analysis, maintenance records, or financial forecasting.

---

### 📈 **4. DATA SET AND ANALYSIS**

* Route-wise trip frequency analysis.
* Vehicle utilization comparison.
* Passenger volume trends by date or route.
* Revenue summary based on bookings and fares.
* Identification of underperforming routes or idle vehicles.

---

### 💡 **5. INSIGHTS DELIVERED**

* Identification of high-demand routes.
* Detection of low-utilization vehicles.
* Peak travel time patterns.
* Operational inefficiencies affecting transport performance.

---

### 🏁 **6. FINAL OUTPUT**

* Structured SQL-based performance reports.
* Summary tables highlighting key operational metrics.
* Clear identification of optimization opportunities.
* Data-driven recommendations to improve transport efficiency and resource utilization.
